# fun_with_llms

This repo contains projects which works with Large Language Models. 

1.) ##emo_event <br>
Some cultures do not have words for certain emotions other cultures have. So for example "German angst" describes a particular sensation of fear which seems to be deeply related<br>
to German culture. But there are many examples too, which I have forgotten and I am too lazy right now to google them.</br>
Anyway, I wanted to know which feelings/emotions an AI can come up with and how it would label them. Play around with the temperature parameter and refine the initial prompt to <br> an output that is more fitting to your needs. Have fun.
