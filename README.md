This repo contains projects which works with Large Language Models. (Okay, right now only one project)

### emo_invent â€“ Human emotions unearthed by the machine<br>
Some cultures do not have words for certain emotions other cultures have. So for example "German angst" describes a particular sensation of fear which seems to be deeply related to German culture. But there are many examples too, which I have forgotten and I am too lazy right now to google them. Anyway, I wanted to know which feelings/emotions an AI can come up with and how it would label them. Play around with the temperature parameter and refine the initial prompt to an output that is more fitting to your needs. **Have fun**.
